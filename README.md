# Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="29px" height="29px">

I am a CS major ( physics minor ) at the University of Waterloo (2025)

I enjoy building small projects for myself from time to time.
I am interested in lots of topics, primarily machine learning methods and their application in the field of biology. other topics I like:

1. AI techniques: Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement, ...
2. Game development
3. Applied mathematics and physics and their application using computer science

Recently I have started doing some Kaggle challenges so that I can have some hands-on ML experience on top of my theoretical knowledge 

I also have a personal blog and sometimes post my thoughts there and on my LinkedIn page. so if you want to know a bit about ME (not work) go read that. I will say it is not the most well written Shakespearean text but its the best I can do.

Reach out to me in these places. ROCK ON üé∏ü§ò
